 abstract = {Resolution of singularities is a powerful and frequently used tool in algebraic geometry. In this book, János Kollár provides a comprehensive treatment of the characteristic 0 case. He describes more than a dozen proofs for curves, many based on the original papers of Newton, Riemann, and Noether. Kollár goes back to the original sources and presents them in a modern context. He addresses three methods for surfaces, and gives a self-contained and entirely elementary proof of a strong and functorial resolution in all dimensions. Based on a series of lectures at Princeton University and written in an informal yet lucid style, this book is aimed at readers who are interested in both the historical roots of the modern methods and in a simple and transparent proof of this important theorem.},

Finally, we mention wrapped Fukaya categories and outline a few applications to symplectic topology, mirror symmetry and low-dimensional topology.",

 abstract = {In each even dimension ≥ 4, families of compact, symplectic manifolds are constructed, such that all finitely presentable groups occur as fundamental groups. For each group, these manifolds can be assumed not to be homotopy equivalent to Kahler manifolds. Other examples are constructed that are homeomorphic, but not diffeomorphic, to simply connected, Kahler surfaces. The geography of compact, symplectic 4-manifolds is studied, with a result that for any fixed fundamental group, it is possible to realize any value of the first Chern number c2 1 or the signature. Explicit results are obtained about simultaneously realizing both Chern numbers (or equivalently, the signature and Euler characteristic), for any fixed fundamental group. Various other applications are presented.},
